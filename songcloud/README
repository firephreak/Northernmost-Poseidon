to install dropbox-client-java.jar:
download api from dropbox

cd dropbox-client-java
mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

To authenticate:
Copy the testing.json file from the dropbox api/config folder to config and fill in your creds.
You will need your own consumer key and secret so go get those from dropbox.
Start jetty, then go to /auth
It will redirect to /dropbox but nothing will show up in the browser yet.
check the terminal window you started jetty from. You should see your account info in JSON format.
