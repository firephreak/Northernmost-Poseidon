// Building SongCloud //
////////////////////////

SongCloud is intended to be built as a maven project. From this directory
run: 
'mvn install'
to compile SongCloud, along with its dependencies, and run all tests.

Note: for all tests to run properly SongCloud must already be running.
To skip the tests run:
'mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true'

The war you will want to deploy will be located at
songcloud/target/songcloud.war upon a successfull build.

Songcloud depends on the Dropbox Client API libraries for Java.
We have included a copy for the sole purposes of making SongCloud easy
to build. This was done without the explicit consent of Dropbox.

Please see https://www.dropbox.com/developers/ for more information.

Songcloud also depends on JID3 which has also been included for ease
of compilation.

Please see http://jid3.blinkenlights.org/ for more information.
